This is a small tool that I made to quickly cleanup and reduce the size of my Unity project's directory. I have many unity projects and that uses a LOT of disk space. This will delete caches and library folders of older projects automatically.

## Overview

Unity Project Keeper is a command-line tool designed to keep your Unity projects organized by managing, filtering, and cleaning up projects based on their last modification date, Unity version, and other parameters. It allows for batch processing using profiles, making it easy to automate project maintenance.
