    Sawce is my masterpiece. It is a group of amazing game developers united by a chat server and the will of making amazing things. We created this group to be able to achieve things greater than one can achieve by himself. We make unity tools, free small and medium games, shaders, tutorials, game development discussions and basically anything related to game development and multimedia.

### Sawce

Sawce is my masterpiece. It is a group of amazing game developers united by a chat server and the will of making amazing things. We created this group to be able to achieve things greater than one can achieve by himself. We make unity tools, free small and medium games, shaders, tutorials, game development discussions and basically anything related to game development and multimedia.

### Sawce Site

I have created the team's web page. This was a great achievement for it allowed us to share our projects and tools with everyone. There we display each project statuses and download links, with each developer that participated in it. We display each developer portfolio's, social media accounts and anything that they want to share.

The site is a platform, built on top of a modern CMS using Twig for templating and a symphony backend. The tech stack was chosen so that I could focus most of my time on the content instead of on the system.
