## Overview

Centralized game design editor. One window to rule them all! One window to edit all design variables across prefabs and scriptable objects... and to cast them into darkness.

This is a unity editor that centralizes the editing of game design variables and settings in a single view. It scans the project for scripts that have design variables and allows the developer
to edit those in a single window. This works for prefabs, variants and scriptable objects. It requires the Odin Inspector asset.

## Why

Most games have a lot of design variables and values spread across different places, maybe directories filled with scriptable objects or prefabs here and there. Even scene objects that the developers forget but hold valuable setup details.
I created this to manage those values for medium sized projects where the number of files became too big to manage directly but the scope is too small for the developer or game team to create custom tooling.
