### What is Botz?

This was a fun project I did for my Computer Graphics course. I had a month to make a 2D game using no libraries, only pure java. I was able to reuse some old code that I had (past engines I made in pure java) to handle all the rendering and UI. This gave me enough time to focus on gameplay programming.

It is a game where you have to explore the resources of a remote planet by building automated robots, processing facilites and upgrading things. You have a main base, build and upgrade commands, and nothing else. Its up to you to solve the problems that arise with many robots and high speeds.

### Work in progress

This first iteration of the game was created for the course and later expanded during a self-adapativity class. In no way this is final. I'm planning a remake using a propper engine and adding multiplayer. The game currently has the following features:

* Base building
* Factory/Resource/Process framework
* Automated robots
* Upgrading
* 'Light' market simulation
