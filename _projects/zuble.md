###  Zumbie Bluetooth Low Energy Unity Library

This is a simple wrapper around android's BLE capabilities. This is a complete jerry-rig implementation. I'll try to improve on-demand. This library currently only handles a single device per connection.

### Features

- Scan BLE Devices with callbacks.

- Connect async and callback.

- Write and read with any Gatt addresses.
