### What is Chromatic Gorilka Typo?

As my teammate said:

This was an amazing game we did for Ludum Dare. We made our own "programmer-friendly" tower defense game. Not traditional but quite the experience.

We expanded this game a lot after Ludum Dare and we are quite happy with our results.

I was responsible for the entire console implementation, integrating the light and shadow system, developing the behavior tree tool that we used, developing all monster AIs, the A* (a-star) path-finder, developing the boss fight system with animation sync, and much more.
