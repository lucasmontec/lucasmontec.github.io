## Overview

Quick Scenes is a free scene organization package to help organizing unity projects. Its a window that shows buttons to scene files so you can navigate to your working set of scenes directly. Scenes are added automatically to this working set when you open a new scene.

I made it to facilitate my Unity workflow going through scenes quickly without having to find them in the project view or searching for them.
